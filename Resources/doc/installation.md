Installation
------------

First, require it thanks to composer:

    composer.phar require troopers/alertify-bundle:~3.0

Add it in your AppKernel.php (pass to next step with Flex ðŸ’ª):

```php
    public function registerBundles() {
        $bundles = [
            //...
            new Troopers\AlertifyBundle\TroopersAlertifyBundle(),
```

Warning: make sure the twig engine is installed and turned on in framework.yaml
If not :

- runs `composer req twig`
- if needed, add the following to `config/packages/framework.yaml` (or `config/config.yml` for symfony <4 versions)

```yaml
framework:
    # ...
    templating:
        engines: ['twig']
```
